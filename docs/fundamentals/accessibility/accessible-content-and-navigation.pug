  * DO use a `<html lang="de" >` tag representing the current page language
  * DO order content in HTML for screen readers
  * DO make functionalites accessible by mouse AND keyboard
  * DO use a meaningful page title. See [diveintoaccessibility](http://diveintoaccessibility.info/download/diveintoaccessibility.pdf)
  * DO provide link tags for navigation support. (e.g. `<link rel="home" href="https://axa.ch" />`) See [diveintoaccessibility](http://diveintoaccessibility.info/download/diveintoaccessibility.pdf)
  * DO use meaningful alt texts on ALL img elements
  * DO use the acronym element to explain the first usage of an acronym and mark this visualy
  * DO provide a summary for tables
  * DO use real h1 through h6 tags for your headings
  * DO make everything searchable. Every page needs a search field, preferably above the formfield
  * DO use common accesskey's (e.g. 0: accessiblity statement, 1: home, ...)
  * DO NOT rely on colors only and respect colorblindness. For example an icon could identify an error message as such for colorblind people.
  * DO use landmarks to categorize content
      * DO use the role="main" landmark for your main content area
      * DO use the role="complementary" landmark for complementary information
      * DO use the role="search" landmark for your page search
      * DO use the role="navigation" landmark for all areas used to navigate (e.g. main navigation, tabs, ...)
      * DO use the role="banner" landmark to mark content that is site and not page specific
      * See [https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2013/02/using-wai-aria-landmarks-2013/](https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2013/02/using-wai-aria-landmarks-2013/) for further landmarks
      * DO NOT have any content that is not assigned to a landmark
      * DO use the HTML5 elements (nav, main, header) in conjunction with the role attribute, but DO NOT rely on them alone. See the link above for the matching of HTML5 to landmarks
  * DO make your website/app navigable with the keyboard. This not only improves accessiblity but also allows power user to use your app more efficently. See [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Keyboard-navigable_JavaScript_widgets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Keyboard-navigable_JavaScript_widgets)
      * DO use tabindex to mark elements as tab navigable or remove the ability to tab into it
      * Be careful when using nested tabindex. This would require manual focus handling. See the link above for further information.
      * See the best practices mention in the article above.
